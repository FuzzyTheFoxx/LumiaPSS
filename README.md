# LumiaPSS
New version of (Now dead) LumiaOS (Project Lumia)


# Basic Info
LumiaPSS (LumiaPythonScriptSystem) will be command-line system.
The old version (LumiaOS) wanted to be the same, but without command line, and text-based UI/UX.

For now it'll be free to modificate & distribute, but with some conditions. *(See license for more info.)*

If you want to support me, report issues at issues page, thank you.

# Source Code: How to?
The [#Dev](https://github.com/FuzzyTheFoxx/LumiaPSS/tree/main/%23Dev) folder is development folder and it's for testing only;
To run my code, it is only possible with python* pre-installed**, and you must know basics of Linux terminal.

# Support
For now the project will have support for Arch Linux
