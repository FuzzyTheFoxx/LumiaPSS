# LumiaPSS
New version of (Now dead) LumiaOS (Project Lumia)


# Basic Info
LumiaPSS (LumiaPythonScriptSystem) will be command-line system.
The old version (LumiaOS) wanted to be the same, but without command line, and text-based UI/UX.

For now it'll be free to modificate & distribute, but with some conditions. *(See license for more info.)*

If you want to support me, report issues at issues page, thank you.

# Support & Compatibility
For now the only supported platforms will be Linux and Windows.

Compatibility guaranteed with Arch Linux and Windows 11
